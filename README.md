# Ft_containers
Ft_continers is a project i have worked during my studies. This project is about re-implementing the vector container from C++.
# Vector
The C++ Standard Library vector class is a class template for sequence containers. A vector stores elements of a given type in a linear arrangement, 
and allows fast random access to any element. A vector is the preferred container for a sequence when random-access performance is at a premium.
# RUN
- ```cd vector```
- ```make```
